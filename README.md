# üìù What is this

What you're looking at right now is what we call our **Phone Book App**. Basically, a free-form place to write to your heart's content! And the best part is... you aren't alone! You can build products using the **[Installation Guide](https://docs.readme.com/docs/suggested-edits)** 

# üö¶ Installation Guide

First of all, I want you guys to download the 2 projects from this repository. So Backend is the REST API Repository for Products - built-in Django Rest Framework. React-Phone-Book is the Frontend Repository - built in React.

- **Contribute to the Django Environments** First step is to install python, pip, and Django and build the virtual environment! Here are the links on how to install python and pip: <https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/tutorials/installing-packages/>
- **Install the Backend and Startup:**  
  After contributing the environments,  you should go to virtual environment and then install requirements using this command:  
  `pip install -r requirements.txt`  
  And then you can migrate and start the backend using this command in VirtualEnvironment:  
  `python manage.py makemigrations`, `python manage.py migrate`,`python manage.py runserver`
- **Start the Frontend:**  
  First of all please check you have installed npm and check the npm version.  
  If your npm is not the latest, please update. Check here: <https://docs.npmjs.com/try-the-latest-stable-version-of-npm/> <https://nodejs.org/en/>  
  And You can start the front using these commands:  
  `npm install` and `npm run start`
